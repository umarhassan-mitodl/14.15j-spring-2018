## Project Ideas

Below is a list of project suggestions. These are merely examples and you are not required to do project from one of these topics. Use them as a “model” to potentially decide on your own project idea. Of course, you are welcome to utilize one of these topics as a project.

6. Analyze what export networks tell us about how countries grow and develop. Is the complexity measure reasonable? Is there a better measure of complexity you can come up with? As an extra empirical exercise, have a look at what import networks can tell you.

    - [SNAP: Network Databases](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/memetracker9.html)
17. Pick a few different network metrics (centralities etc) and implement them on Apache Spark using RDDs or GraphFrames. Run these on large networks—how do different centralities differ in terms of performance, parallelizability, ease/difficulty of implementation?
